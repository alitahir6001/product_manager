React CRUD app for creating products

A webapp to create, read, update and delete (CRUD) products and items for a store. This is one of several CRUD apps I wrote in react.js using node and mongoDB 
for the back-end and demonstrate full-stack functionality for react.

Features:
  - Form to create item, which displays on a table below the form fields.
  - Product/item description, along with buttons to edit, view and delete the product information, which then re-routes back to main page.
  
Future goals:
  - Separate the create form away from the table for modularization practice
  - Add some design and background color! While I care more about functionality, I need to practice adding some eye-candy to these apps
  - Practice linking to Amazon for items based on general type (home, office, sports, pet, etc.)
